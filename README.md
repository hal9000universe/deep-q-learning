# deep-reinforcement-learning

The goal of this repository is to experiment 
with various reinforcement learning algorithms
and apply them to different environments.

# TODO
- stabilize learning process
- test neural-collapse enforcing on mnist and cifar
- implement hyperparameter optimization
- fix prioritized experience replay (+testing)
- learn CartPole, Pong, Breakout
